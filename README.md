# Python Code for TV Product Data Analysis

## Overview
This Python script is designed for analyzing TV product data. It focuses on data preprocessing, feature extraction, text processing, similarity scoring, clustering, and performance evaluation. The script processes data from JSON files to identify similarities and differences among TV products.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy, statsmodels, matplotlib

## Installation
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:


## Usage
1. Place your JSON file containing TV product data in the same directory as the script. The expected format is a collection of product entries with features.
2. Run the script with Python:

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Functions to clean and preprocess the data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts and processes features from the product data.
- **Title Processing**: Converts product titles into binary vectors.
- **Similarity Calculation**: Includes functions to compute q-gram similarity and key-value pair similarity.
- **Clustering**: Uses Agglomerative Clustering for grouping similar products.
- **Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**: Implements MinHash and LSH for efficient similarity detection.
- **Candidate Pair Generation**: Functions to generate and refine candidate pairs based on similarity.
- **Evaluation**: Bootstrap method for evaluating the performance of the model.

## Customization
- The script can be customized to handle different data formats or to extract different types of features.
- Clustering parameters and similarity thresholds can be adjusted according to the dataset.
